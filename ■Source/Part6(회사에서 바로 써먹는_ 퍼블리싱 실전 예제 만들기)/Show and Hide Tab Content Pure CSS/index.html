        <h2>london</h2>
        <p>
          As the “capital of capitals”—still waist-deep in an opaque pandemic slurry—negotiates the uncharted, perilous terrain of a post-Brexit world, London continues to reign the planet’s best cities for the sixth year running. Its position at the top, however, has never been more tenuous.

        <h2>paris</h2>
        <p>
          Paris attacked the pandemic not only with its doctors and health-care workers, but also with its urban planners. For all the talk of learning from the pandemic, one city appears to be going all-in on the hard lessons it gave and their application to molecular urban change.

        <h2>new york</h2>
        <p>
          If New York City forgot about how bad life can get for its citizenry, the past 18 months were a hellish reminder. The greatest city in America—lauded and crowned in our ranking for the past six years and in countless others for many more—was a ghastly reminder during the pandemic.

        <h2>dubai</h2>
        <p>
          An alluring blend of over-the-top experiences, Arab heritage and luxury shopping, Dubai is so over the pandemic. Dubai is a city of superlatives: you can ride the elevator to the top of the world’s tallest building for a bird’s-eye view, bet on the ponies at the world’s richest.
